__Feature-rich server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition 0.12.1__

Introduction
-------------
Prismarine-0.12 is a fork of **[PocketMine++](https://github.com/PrismarineMC/PocketMinePlusPlus-Legacy)** and most of the original code was written by **PocketMine Team** and our team a long time ago.<br>
Some of the extended functionality that Prismarine offers:

* Synapse Client support

However, Prismarine-0.12 still has a long way to go. We welcome contributions.
